        "A powerful spirit that lives in deep forests. Dryads live in large, ancient trees and are extremely timid. They dislike combat and excel at support magic. Sometimes, as a prank, they enslave people with magic and bend them to their will. For ages, youths who disappeared in the forest have been said to have become the slaves of Dryads.",
        "A powerful elf that lives in the deep forest. Known as the forest's guardian, it doesn't age and has beautiful looks and a nearly eternal lifespan. It dislikes fighting and its immensely powerful magic is usually used for defense rather than offense. Although very conservative, a curious one may leave the forest with a human it is interested in.",
        "Having lived for an eternity, a High Elf then sublimates her affectionate nature and evolves into a protector of all the forest's creatures. Lemenara had also protected them during the great war with the gods, but the forest was eventually burned down by their army. Seeing the forest burn, the soft smile disappeared from her face, and she then ferociously sought revenge against the gods. In the battle that ensued, the white wreath upon her head was stained red with the blood of the gods.",
        "Lemenara's new form after evolving in order to fight against the gods. Said to love all creatures who care for and respect the land, she hates those who mean to hurt and destroy it. Thus, she refuses to forgive the gods who seek to destroy these humans meant to love the nature that surrounds them. However, this doesn't mean that she favors the human race over any other. Were she to find a human who disrespected the land, she would strike him or her with as much fury as that of the gods themselves."

In addition, it also has the tough scales and sharp claws of a dragon. Its thunder attack is even more powerful than Ziz's and its area of attack is much wider than before. It's said that once you're targeted by Zazabis, there's nowhere to run and hide.",

Since the time when the heavens and the earth were created, this astral being has watched over the land from the skies. No human has ever laid eyes upon this creature, and only one line in all of mythology actually references it: 'Storms are born when Ardas flaps its wings, and its cries manifest into thunder clouds.' Whoever manages to summon this legendary bird will gain the power to change the entire world."

The reason being that as soon as she had finished bringing down a powerful god, she then pointed her sword at a human hero. The blade that had once carried the hopes of the human race would now bring despair instead."

Her actions inspired the rest to rise up and defeat him once and for all... or so they had thought. He still had another trick up his sleeve that could render all their efforts pointless."
