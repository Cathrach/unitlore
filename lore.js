        "A great monk from the church of the water god, Salam, in the ruined Sama Kingdom. Putting dogma first led to harsh criticism, but she stuck steadfast to her principles. Always treating people fair regardless of their position led to many supporting her. She was popular and her magic was strong. She saved countless, rich and poor, with her healing magic.",
        "A great monk from the ruined Sama Kingdom that once prayed to the water god, Saram. After the war with the gods began, she was torn as to what she should do as she had previously served them. In the end, she went to the front lines and used her healing magic to save people. Without fighting against the gods, she saved the people who were hurt. That was probably as far as she could go in resisting the gods."

Sometimes, as a prank, they enslave people with magic and bend them to their will. For ages, youths who disappeared in the forest have been said to have become the slaves of Dryads.",
        "A powerful elf that lives in the deep forest. Known as the forest's guardian, it doesn't age and has beautiful looks and a nearly eternal lifespan. It dislikes fighting and its immensely powerful magic is usually used for defense rather than offense. Although very conservative, a curious one may leave the forest with a human it is interested in.",
        "Having lived for an eternity, a High Elf then sublimates her affectionate nature and evolves into a protector of all the forest's creatures. Lemenara had also protected them during the great war with the gods, but the forest was eventually burned down by their army. Seeing the forest burn, the soft smile disappeared from her face, and she then ferociously sought revenge against the gods. In the battle that ensued, the white wreath upon her head was stained red with the blood of the gods.",
        "Lemenara's new form after evolving in order to fight against the gods. Said to love all creatures who care for and respect the land, she hates those who mean to hurt and destroy it. Thus, she refuses to forgive the gods who seek to destroy these humans meant to love the nature that surrounds them. However, this doesn't mean that she favors the human race over any other. Were she to find a human who disrespected the land, she would strike him or her with as much fury as that of the gods themselves."

It's said that once you're targeted by Zazabis, there's nowhere to run and hide.",

Sailors fear seeing it and always offer prayers and sacrifices before setting sail.",

It is said to be comparatively gentle, but once provoked, its rage is unforgiving, causing storm after storm until the the seas part and everything sinks to the abyss.",

Another said, 'All souls lost at sea return to Felneus.' As widely and broadly depicted as it was, every mention of the sea dragon spoke of how powerful and magnificent it was. Once discovered there was an outcry that 'The world has lost another of its secrets.'"

It is worshipped as the God Tree as it has the ability to sprout life all around it.",

It appears that the faces that can be seen on him now represent his main personalities, with all important conversations going through them."
